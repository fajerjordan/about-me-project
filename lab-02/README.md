In this "About Me Guessing Game" I ask the user 5 questions about me, then I let him guess the answers if he answered correctly alert messages will showen  to tell him that your answers are correct. if not I also alert messages will showen  to tell him the correct answers.
Then I ask a user about his name, to welcoming him by alert welcoming message.
